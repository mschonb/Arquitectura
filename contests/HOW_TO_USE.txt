How to use this tool to create contests:

1. Create the raw file in the following format rules:
	-Blank lines are ignored
		+If the line is all whitespace, it is considered blank
	-The first character of a line denotes the type of data it contains
		+The first character is not saved to the json file
	-After a question, the next four non-empty lines must be the possible answers
		+The correct answer starts with a + sign
		+Incorrect answers start with a - sign
	-The title and category of the contest can be in any part of the document, but should preferably be at the begining for easy reading.
	-For examples:
		+ The file raw/template.txt is a an example
		+ The file json/template.json is the result
		+ The file json/template_formatted.json is a nice-looking version of json/template.json
	-The following is an example contest with one question.

	@Title of the contest
	#Category
	?Question goes here
	-Answer option 1
	-Answer option 2
	-Answer option 3
	+Answer option 4

2. Run python script raw_to_json.py with two parameters
	-First parameter is the path to the raw file
	-Second parameter is the path to use for the output JSON
	For example, run the following command from this directory to create the template.json file

		python raw_to_json.py raw/template.json json/template.json


	Note: This is untested in UNIX systems, so if the arguments don't work, make a copy of the script, disable the lines with the comments 'dynamic input' and 'dynamic output', and re-enable the lines with the comments 'hard-coded input' and 'hard-coded output'

3. Done!
